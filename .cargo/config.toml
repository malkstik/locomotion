# Cargo configuration for MuJoCo setup
# This tells mujoco-rs where to find the MuJoCo dynamic library

[env]
# User-local installation (macOS user frameworks - RECOMMENDED)
# Replace 'aarontran' with your username if different
MUJOCO_DYNAMIC_LINK_DIR = "/Users/aarontran/Library/Frameworks/Versions/Current"

# Alternative locations (uncomment if you installed elsewhere):
#
# System-wide frameworks (requires sudo to install):
# MUJOCO_DYNAMIC_LINK_DIR = "/Library/Frameworks/Versions/Current"
#
# Homebrew installation (if/when available):
# MUJOCO_DYNAMIC_LINK_DIR = "/opt/homebrew/lib"
#
# Traditional Unix location:
# MUJOCO_DYNAMIC_LINK_DIR = "/usr/local/lib"
#
# Different user (update username):
# MUJOCO_DYNAMIC_LINK_DIR = "/Users/yourname/Library/Frameworks/Versions/Current"
